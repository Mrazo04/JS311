tell them: 

email and password

they: store the email and a hash for password // it's pretty easy to go from password to hash but very difficult to go from hash to password 

md5sum 

sha224sum

// to build this out we need to store email and hash
/register route: this will accept the email and password, but it will store the email and hash
/login route: this will accept the email and password, it will check to see if there is a hash stored for that email 
and then will hash the password entered in login route
and will then check if both hashes (the one stored for the email and the one enetered to login) match

Steps: 
1.  get info from request, email and password
2.  convert incoming password into a hash (skip, because the library will compare password to hash)
3.  retrieve the hash from the database
4.  if the user exists, then compare the hash we just generated to the hash from the database
to decide if the login failed or not 
5.  if the user does not exist, then say login failed
